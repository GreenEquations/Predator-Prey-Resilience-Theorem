# ðŸ“˜ Predator-Prey Resilience Theorem

## I. Theorem Statement

Ecosystems with predator-prey interactions exhibit **variable resilience** depending on the presence of:

- Time-delayed predator response
- Nonlinear feedback to external disturbance
- Species dispersal and spatial migration
- Multi-trophic structure and predator substitution

These factors alter the systemâ€™s ability to **recover**, **absorb**, or **collapse** under ecological shocks.

## II. Formal Model Components

### 1. Time Delay in Predator Response

A delay-differential version of Lotka-Volterra dynamics:

    dP/dt = Î± * P * (1 - P / K) - Î² * P(t - Ï„) * Q(t)  
    dQ/dt = Î´ * P(t - Ï„) * Q(t) - Î³ * Q

Where:
- Ï„: Time delay between prey abundance and predator response

---

### 2. Nonlinear Resilience Function

The predatorâ€™s resilience to disturbance is modeled as:

    R(t) = Ïˆ * exp( -Ï• * D(t) )

Where:
- R(t): Resilience function
- D(t): Disturbance input (e.g., climate event, disease)
- Ïˆ: Maximum adaptive amplitude
- Ï•: Sensitivity coefficient

---

### 3. Migration and Spatial Diffusion

Introduced via spatial Laplacian terms:

    âˆ‚P/âˆ‚t = ... + D_p * âˆ‡Â²P(x, t)  
    âˆ‚Q/âˆ‚t = ... + D_q * âˆ‡Â²Q(x, t)

Where:
- D_p, D_q: Species-specific diffusion coefficients
- âˆ‡Â²: Laplacian operator (spatial spread)

---

## III. Predictions

1. Delayed predator response causes over- or under-shoot of prey recovery.
2. High Ï• (sensitivity) leads to faster collapse post-disturbance.
3. Migration reduces local collapse but increases volatility across regions.
4. Systems with overlapping predators are more likely to rebound than single-predator systems.

---

## IV. Simulation Proposal

- **Model**: Use delay-differential solvers + spatial diffusion
- **Disturbance Input**: Randomized shocks (Gaussian, Poisson)
- **Resilience Testing**: Vary Ïˆ and Ï• under different spatial scales
- **Tools**: MATLAB, SciPy, Julia, R with `deSolve`, or NetLogo

## V. Empirical Basis

- **Isle Royale**: Wolf-moose cycle collapse and partial recovery
- **Atlantic Cod Collapse**: Delayed predation and trophic realignment
- **Ecosystem Resilience Literature**: Thresholds and phase shifts in ecological networks

## VI. Applications

- **Conservation Ecology**: Identify species at risk of non-recovery
- **Climate Disturbance Modeling**: Project ecosystem recovery thresholds
- **Complex Systems Theory**: Test cross-scale resilience using interaction topology
