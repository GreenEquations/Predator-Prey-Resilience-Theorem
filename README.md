Predator-Prey Resilience Theorem: Effects of External Disturbances on Ecological Stability
Welcome to the Predator-Prey Resilience Theorem repository! This project focuses on modeling how external disturbances (such as climate change, habitat destruction, and resource depletion) affect ecological stability and the dynamics between predator-prey systems.

The model extends the well-established Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model by incorporating key elements like species migration, time lags, non-linear effects, and multi-species interactions. It aims to simulate how different types and magnitudes of disturbances influence the resilience and stability of ecosystems.

This repository serves as a collaborative space for sharing data, simulations, and model improvements. Contributions from researchers and practitioners are highly encouraged to refine and expand the model, making it more applicable to real-world systems.

Key Features:
External Disturbances: Gradual and sudden changes in environmental factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and resource depletion.

Time Lags: Delay-differential equations capture time lags in prey population responses to disturbances.

Species Migration: Models how prey migration to refuge areas and predator movement influences ecological dynamics.

Non-Linear Effects: Incorporates non-linear dynamics such as predator functional responses and stochastic variations in disturbance events.

Multi-Species and Multi-Trophic Levels: Expands to include multi-species interactions and food web dynamics for more complex ecosystems.

Empirical Validation: Built with real-world case studies such as wolf-moose dynamics on Isle Royale and cod-herring dynamics in the North Sea to test and validate the model.

Collaborate & Contribute:
We invite researchers, data scientists, and ecologists to contribute to the development and validation of the Predator-Prey Resilience Theorem. There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

Empirical Validation:
We encourage contributions of empirical data that can help validate the model's predictions. Current case studies include:

Wolf-Moose Dynamics on Isle Royale: Data on predator-prey cycles and the effects of climate change.

Cod-Herring Dynamics in the North Sea: Analysis of how overfishing and climate change affect predator-prey interactions.

If you have access to any other datasets that model predator-prey dynamics, habitat destruction, climate change, or other relevant disturbances, please consider sharing them to improve the model's accuracy.

Future Work:
The model is currently expanding to include spatial dynamics and multi-species interactions. If you are working on related ecosystem models, spatial modeling, or multi-trophic system simulations, we would be happy to integrate your contributions.

Next steps:
Spatial dynamics modeling: Integrating patch models, network models, or grid-based approaches for heterogeneous environments.

Expanding disturbance types: Exploring how pollution, invasive species, and other disturbances impact ecological stability.

Advanced non-linear dynamics: Further investigation of feedback mechanisms and ecological tipping points.
