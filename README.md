# 🧠 Predator-Prey Resilience Theorem

## Overview

This theorem extends classic predator-prey models by introducing concepts of **resilience**, **adaptive responses**, and **multi-species dynamics** under ecological stress and systemic disturbances.

It defines conditions under which ecosystems **absorb**, **adjust**, or **collapse** in response to external shocks — incorporating **time lags**, **nonlinear predator response**, **migration**, and **multi-trophic interactions**.

## 📐 Model Extensions

### 1. Time Lag / Delay Differential Dynamics
- Predator response to prey density is delayed by a factor τ:
  
      dP/dt = α * P * (1 - P / K) - β * P(t - τ) * Q(t)

### 2. Adaptive Predator Response
- Introduces nonlinear resilience term R(t):
  
      R(t) = ψ * exp( -ϕ * D(t) )

Where:
- D(t): Disturbance intensity
- ϕ: Sensitivity of the predator response
- ψ: Maximum response amplitude

### 3. Migration / Spatial Spread
- Adds a migration term M(x, t):

      ∂P/∂t = ... + D_p * ∇²P(x, t)

Where:
- D_p: Prey dispersal coefficient
- ∇²: Laplacian operator representing spatial diffusion

## 🔬 Empirical Foundation

- **Isle Royale Wolves and Moose** (US National Park Service):
  - Predator collapse and delayed recovery post-disease
  - Lag in predator response to prey rebound

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Atlantic Cod and Forage Fish Collapse**:
  - Top-down collapse in multi-trophic system
  - Evidence of reduced resilience to environmental shocks

---

## 🧪 Testable Predictions

1. Populations with time-lagged predator response will overshoot prey recovery thresholds.
2. Ecosystems with low R(t) sensitivity (high ϕ) collapse faster post-shock.
3. Migration dampens local collapse but increases system-wide variability.

- Model R(t) dynamics with stochastic disturbance input
- Spatial models via diffusion-based PDEs
- Tools: MATLAB, Python (SciPy), R (deSolve), Julia (DifferentialEquations.jl)
